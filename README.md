## Local Development

this depends on npm and node :)

signing up at [github.com](https://github.com) is a good idea too!

To serve the site from a simple Node development server:

    npm start

Then launch the site from your favourite browser:

[__http://localhost:3000/__](http://localhost:3000/)

If you wish to serve the site from a different port:

    PORT=8000 npm start

## Deployment

make an account at [now.sh](https://now.sh), preferably through github :)

install the [now](https://zeit.co/download) client

run the `now` command in the root folder of the project repository to host its contents!

this readme file is in the root of the project repository :)
